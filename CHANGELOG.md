# Changelog

Versions follow `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Dates are commit dates.

## 0.11.0 (2026-10-17)

- The repair channel: `shorthand.reserved_metawords` (CORRECTION,
  SAY-AGAIN, UNVERIFIED) returns to the shipped config. `check` names a
  ratified term nearer one than `min_token_edit_distance`, and `ratify`
  makes such a proposal not eligible; both exit 2 on a word with whitespace
  or a shell character. The translator passes each word verbatim; the
  `never_compress` class `reserved-metawords` is this list.
- `shorthand.register_marker` (`required`): the translator ends its marker
  line ` · shorthand` when the narrative keeps a ratified term unexpanded.
  `check` exits 2 on a value other than `required` or `optional`.
- The triggers: `shorthand.readback_required_for` and
  `shorthand.decompress_on`, read and checked by `use` each call. `use --for
  CLASS` refuses a class not listed, or a clean use without `--readback`,
  and records `for`. With `repeated-fidelity-failure` listed, a term with 2
  failure uses gets a `decompress:` line, which the respeak skill relays.
  The translator decompresses in each listed case, whatever
  `lexicon_access` says, and states an item it could not read back in
  full, flagged `not read back`.
- `respeak-lexicon.py audit` reads a fresh decoder's `<term>: <decoding>`
  lines for today's sample on stdin. A term is decoded when each word of
  its expansion begins a word of the decoding. It appends a record a term
  to `.claude/respeak/audits.jsonl`, then writes the lexicon's `audited:`
  line by rename, and exits 0 whatever is decoded; it refuses the seed, a
  symlink, a term outside the sample and a term twice. The new skill
  `/respeak:audit` runs `due`, gives the sample to a fresh agent, and
  passes its lines to `audit`.
- An empty `--root` exits 2. `.gitattributes`, now also `audits.jsonl
  merge=union`, is written whenever it is absent, not only when `use`
  creates the record. `due` reads `reviewed:` on ratified entries only.

## 0.10.0 (2026-10-16)

- `plugin/scripts/respeak-lexicon.py due` reads the lexicon's three clocks
  and writes nothing. An entry is due to retire after 180 days with no
  clean use, counted from the later of its newest clean use and its
  `ratified_by` date. It is due for review every 90 days from its `reviewed:` date, else
  `ratified_by`. The fresh-decoder audit falls due 30 days after the
  lexicon's top-level `audited:` date and names a sample of 10 ratified
  terms, chosen by the day. A person writes `reviewed:` and `audited:`.
  `due` exits 0 whatever is due, and 2 on a bad value.
- `retire_after_days_unused`, `review_cadence_days` and `legibility_audit`
  return to the shipped config, tagged with their reader; only `due` checks
  them.
- The translator, when the caller asks, ends with a `uses:` line naming
  each lexicon term the source used, clean or a failure, with readback. The
  respeak skill asks for it, drops it before the gate and the relay, and
  runs `respeak-lexicon.py use` for each term. `respeak-render.sh` never
  asks. The translator still has no Bash.
- `use`, when it creates `.claude/respeak/uses.jsonl`, also writes
  `.claude/respeak/.gitattributes` with `uses.jsonl merge=union` if there is
  none, so two branches that each record a use merge cleanly.
- Without `--root`, every verb works on the top of the git work tree that
  holds the current directory, else the current directory. Run from a
  subdirectory, it reads the project's files, not the seed.
- A lexicon date out of range, such as `2026-13-01`, exits 2 with one line
  instead of a traceback, as does an audit date past 9999-12-31.
- Every verb refuses a lexicon term that holds whitespace or a shell
  character (`` ` `` `$` `;` `|` `&` `<` `>` `"` `'` `\`), since the skill
  passes each term to `use` on a command line, in single quotes. The seed's
  terms pass.
- `respeak-lexicon.py` writes no `__pycache__` for the modules it loads.

## 0.9.0 (2026-10-16)

- `plugin/scripts/respeak-lexicon.py check` holds the ratified entries to
  `shorthand.max_entries` (150) and `shorthand.min_token_edit_distance` (2,
  Levenshtein over case-folded terms, each ratified pair). It prints a line
  per problem, then one `lexicon:` line, and exits 0, 1 on a problem, or 2
  on a bad value or lexicon.
- `respeak-lexicon.py use TERM --outcome clean|failure` appends one JSON
  line to `.claude/respeak/uses.jsonl`, committed beside the lexicon:
  `term`, `date`, `outcome`, `readback`, then `source`. The date is UTC
  today or `RESPEAK_TODAY`. It refuses a term the lexicon lacks or has
  retired. Nothing calls it yet.
- `respeak-lexicon.py ratify` judges each proposed entry by `shorthand.auto`
  (`uses: 5`, `fidelity_failures_allowed: 0`, `readback_evidence: true`),
  the distance, the cap and `legibility_floor`, and prints each verdict with
  its reasons. It exits 0 whatever the verdicts and writes nothing: a person
  ratifies.
- The three keys return to the shipped config, each tagged with its
  reader, and the script reads them from the plugin defaults and the
  project file only. As with `/respeak:include`, the project file counts
  only when git tracks it as a regular file inside the project. The seed
  lexicon's `uses:` field is not read; its header points at the use record.

## 0.8.1 (2026-10-14)

- The shipped config drops the ten `shorthand.*` keys nothing read:
  `auto`, `max_entries`, `min_token_edit_distance`,
  `retire_after_days_unused`, `review_cadence_days`, `legibility_audit`,
  `register_marker`, `reserved_metawords`, `readback_required_for` and
  `decompress_on`. A project file that still sets one resolves and
  validates as before, with no default under it; `NICE_TO_HAVE.md` holds
  the plan.
- The translator states that work is done, fixed, passing or green only
  when the source holds the tool result that shows it. Otherwise it renders
  the claim as claimed and not verified, with what would verify it. The
  include template, now v2, carries the rule in one sentence and shortens
  two others to stay under the cap. Every rendered include reads stale
  until `/respeak:include write` runs again.
- `scripts/hygiene` keeps only the generic groups (`home`, `lan`,
  `sibling`, `secret`, `email`). It reads the terms private to one owner from
  a private list outside the repo: `$AGENTIK_HYGIENE_PRIVATE`, else
  `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/agentik/hygiene-private.tsv`, one
  `group<TAB>regex` per line. With no list it prints one stderr line and scans
  the generic groups; `--require-private` exits 2 instead. It never prints a
  regex from the list.
- The repo names nothing private: records name other repos by stand-ins
  (`example-app`, `example-mac`, `example-site`), the marketplace's owner is
  `agentik-dev`, and `.hygiene-allow` allows no private group outside
  `LICENSE` and the plugin manifest's author.

## 0.8.0 (2026-10-12)

- `/respeak:init` proposes `gate.include` through `respeak-include.py
  propose`: the human-lane files present at the root, or `["**/*.md"]`. With
  consent it seeds that list and `narrative.profile: peer-engineer`, renders
  the include file and offers `@.claude/respeak/include.md`.
- `hooks.session_start`, default `false`, any layer, turns the SessionStart
  lexicon note on; `validate` refuses a non-boolean. This repo sets it. A
  repo with `.claude/respeak/` loses the note until it sets the key `true`.
- `/respeak:init` offers the `lexicon-active.md` import only when the repo
  has its own `.claude/respeak/lexicon.yaml`.
- `include write` names a tracked config or lexicon digest that differs from
  HEAD on stderr; the exit stays 0. The wrapper is `scripts/py`;
  `respeak-py.sh` execs it.

## 0.7.0 (2026-10-11)

- `/respeak:include` writes or checks a repo's static include file
  (design/include-r1.md): the repo's default writing rules, at most 1,500
  bytes, rendered by `plugin/scripts/respeak-include.py` from
  `plugin/config/include.md.tmpl`, the plugin defaults and the repo's
  git-tracked `.claude/respeak/config.yaml` only. The repo ships the file
  and imports it with an `@` line, so a reader without respeak gets the
  rules. `write` exits 2 over the cap and writes nothing; `check` exits 0
  when current, 1 on drift and 2 on a usage error. No model runs.
- `scripts/readme-render.sh` runs the renderer as a marked helper
  (relay-r1 §10): its `claude -p` gets `CLAUDE_SESSION_DEPTH` one deeper and
  `CLAUDE_SESSION_HELPER=1`, and `RELAY_ROW` and `CLAUDE_SESSION_MAX_TURNS`
  pass through as given, so Stop and `start.json` skip it instead of reading
  it as a sitting. A `CLAUDE_SESSION_DEPTH` that is not a plain non-negative
  integer, or a helper past depth 2, exits 2 before anything is written.
- `scripts/hygiene`, `scripts/doclint` and `scripts/bounded` are re-synced
  to claude-code-session `db648f3`, and `make hygiene` now pins `bounded` by
  hash with the other two. Hygiene reads a file over 4 MiB in chunks instead
  of by its path only. `bounded` kills the command's reported process group
  when its guardian stalls (ADV11-1), and a nested run prints
  `bounded: nested stop:` (ADV11-2). doclint fails closed on runner words
  (ADV11-4), and its spent list mirrors agent-relay's. `make check` runs
  `tests/test_bounded.sh` inside `bounded`, so its three stop-line cases now
  run at depth 0.
- `respeak-check` reads a project file only from the work tree whose index
  holds the target (review ADV11-1). A nested repository could commit a
  project file at `fail_on: none` in its own index, hide it from the outer
  repository with `.git/info/exclude`, and turn a block into a pass while the
  outer `git status` stayed clean. That file is now skipped and named in
  `dropped` as an untracked project file.
- A git failure under `respeak-check` now exits 2 and prints its
  `respeak-config: git failed` line (review ADV11-2). Before, a git call that
  failed or timed out read as "untracked", the root project file was dropped,
  and a blocked doc was reported as skipped with rc 0. The run stops at the
  first failure. `RESPEAK_GIT_TIMEOUT` sets the per-call limit (10 s by
  default).
- `respeak-render` reports more account failures as exit 4 (review
  ADV11-5). The pattern now matches `limit reached` and `rate_limit`, so a
  5-hour limit, a weekly limit and an API 429 stop the run. A limit line that
  the runner prints as plain text on stdout is found as well; before, it read
  as a runner failure, rc 2. The relay owns the canonical pattern; a test per
  measured phrasing guards this copy until a re-sync.
- The survivor tests in `tests/test_bounded.sh` and `tests/test_render.sh`
  count only this run's processes (review ADV11-4). Each marker carries the
  run's pid and is matched whole with `pgrep -fx`, so a sibling worktree
  running the same suite no longer turns a pass into a fail. Decoys that an
  unanchored pattern would count stay alive through every survivor case.
- The Makefile comment on `make check` now says the gate reads the last
  `bounded: stop:` line anywhere in stderr (review ADV11-3). make prints its
  own `Error 2` line after that line, so the last stderr line was never
  bounded's. `make readme`'s account failure is likewise its
  `respeak-render: account failure` line, not the exit.
- `scripts/hygiene`, `scripts/doclint` and `scripts/bounded` are re-synced
  to claude-code-session `35b5870`. Hygiene now scans binary files: a secret
  or a home path inside a binary is a hit, a UTF-16 file is read as text, and
  a file over 4 MiB is scanned by its path only. `bounded` cuts the command
  once: after the first TERM, INT or HUP it ignores the other two, so it exits
  128 plus the first signal's number. `tests/test_bounded.sh` covers TERM,
  INT and HUP in turn; the old copy exited 129.
- `scripts/hygiene`, `scripts/doclint` and `scripts/bounded` are re-synced
  to claude-code-session `330bded`. `make check` runs under an 840 s wall. A
  refusal or the wall ends stderr with `bounded: stop: lock|load|wall`, which
  means the suite did not run, not that it failed. Every packet has a `verify`
  row. `tests/test_bounded.sh` covers review ADV10-2, 4 and 5: the stop lines,
  one runner per lock at any lock age, and no process left behind when the
  runner's group is killed.

- `README.md` is rendered again by `make readme` and now ends in a
  newline, as its source does (ruling 11).
- `readme-render.sh` writes the status line into a copy of
  `design/readme/source.md` in its temp directory, renders and verifies the
  copy, and moves the copy over the source and the render over `README.md`
  only after the verifier passes. The renderer keeps the source's final
  newline: a source ending in one gives an output ending in exactly one. The
  failures: a failed `make readme` rewrote the source's status line, and a
  rendered `README.md` lost its final newline (review ADV10-6, ruling 10).
- The renderer treats a runner result with `is_error` true, or a `subtype`
  other than `success`, as a failure, and writes nothing to `--out`: the
  narrative goes to a temp name and moves over `--out` only on success. An
  account failure (usage limit, `/login`, not logged in, invalid API key,
  credit balance, OAuth token expired) exits 4 with one stderr line,
  `respeak-render: account failure: <first line>`; `readme-render.sh`
  passes 4 through. The failure: the renderer wrote a usage-limit message
  to `--out` as the narrative (review ADV10-3).
- `respeak-deadline.sh` starts its watchdog in a process group of its own.
  The watchdog ticks once a second, and when the script is gone or the wall
  has passed it stops the command's group: TERM, then KILL after
  `RESPEAK_DEADLINE_GRACE` seconds (default 2, was 5). The renderer and
  `readme-render.sh` run under it. When the command ends first, the script
  kills the watchdog's group, so no timer outlives a run. The failure: a
  SIGKILL to the caller's group killed the watchdog but left the runner
  alive, and every run left a `sleep` of the wall's length behind (review
  ADV10-2, ADV10-7).
- `gate --committed` reads the project file only when git tracks it, and
  reads it from the index. An untracked or ignored project file is skipped
  and named in `dropped`; outside a git work tree the resolver exits 2 and
  `respeak-gate.sh --committed` exits 3. The failure: an ignored nested
  `.claude/respeak/config.yaml` at `fail_on: none` let `respeak-check`
  pass a blocked file (review ADV10-1).
- The README source is rewritten as the public document: why respeak
  exists, install with `make install` and `make doctor`, every command and
  skill, the tests by file, and the conventions shared with the sibling
  plugins. The references move to `docs/references.md`, and the icon moves
  to `assets/icon.svg`. `scripts/readme-render.sh` writes a status line
  (version, render date, unittest cases, bash suites) before each render
  and exits 2 without one. The failure: the README's status was hand-kept,
  and the source failed its own sentence budget.
- `scripts/hygiene` and `scripts/doclint` are re-synced to the session's
  canonical copies, and the relay rows name their packet by a repo-relative
  path. `make check` runs under `scripts/bounded`: one run per tree by the
  lock `.check.lock`, a 900 s wall, and a hold above load 4 x cores. The
  failure: two checks in one tree ran at once, a hung check had no wall,
  and a rows file named the owner's home.
- Six notes from review R6 move into the files they govern. `CLAUDE.md`
  says a change under about ten lines is gated, not passed; README links
  are `/`-rooted; the README source has a 24,576-byte ceiling.
  config-layers records that Apple's python stays a hook-time candidate
  and names `--committed` for CI. The Makefile names where the pinned
  scripts are copied from, and the renderer says why the icon line sits
  under the title. The failure: these rules lived only in sitting notes.
- `respeak-check.sh` is hermetic. It gates each file with
  `respeak-gate.sh --committed`, which reads `gate.*` from the plugin
  defaults and the committed project file only and names each key it
  dropped. It also unsets `RESPEAK_CONFIG`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and
  `XDG_STATE_HOME`. A file the gate cannot judge exits 3 and counts as an
  error. The failure: a folder file, an ignored local file, the
  environment, or the session provider could turn the check green.
- `scripts/readme-fresh.sh` runs `respeak-verify-edit.py` over the source
  and the README once the hashes match, and `--stamp` refuses a README
  the verifier rejects. A stamp without its source is stale, and a source
  over 24,576 bytes is its own verdict. The failure: a README edited by
  hand and re-stamped read fresh, and deleting the source read skipped.
- Every spawn has a bound. The new `respeak-deadline.sh` runs a command in
  its own process group and kills the whole group at its wall clock (exit
  124). The renderer refuses before it starts a runner when
  `RESPEAK_RENDER_DEPTH` is set, when the load is over `RESPEAK_LOAD_MAX`,
  or when `--max-rounds` is not 1 to 5. The runner gets `--tools` and
  `--max-turns` and a 600 s wall clock. `make readme` calls
  `scripts/readme-render.sh`, which writes `README.md` only after the
  verifier passes. The gate blocks a file over 2 MB as too large to gate
  and gives measure 15 s. `validate` and each suite run under the helper.
  The failure: a hung runner, a large file, or a render inside a render
  had no bound, and a failed render was left in `README.md`.
- The Makefile finds the virtualenv's `python3` by path, with no process,
  and exports its bin dir first on `PATH`, so no recipe or hook goes
  through the pyenv shim. `CLAUDE ?= claude` names the CLI that `install`
  and `validate` run, and `install` exits 2 when it is missing. The
  failure: the shim's lock stalled every make under load, and the install
  suite relied on a fake `claude` staying first on `PATH`.
- The suites stay off the real checkout. `tests/test_check.sh` no longer
  gates this repository's own docs, because `make doclint` does, and
  `tests/test_report_env.sh` runs a fake `claude` in every case. The
  failure: every `make check` scanned the same 36 docs twice and ran the
  real `claude --version`.

- `scripts/hygiene` and `scripts/doclint` are re-synced to the canonical
  copies (conventions section 6), and the Makefile pins move in the same
  commit. Hygiene no longer checks charters under `history/sittings/` for
  a person's name, so that allow row drops `person`. Doclint now checks
  the plugin's agents and commands. The failure: the pins lagged the
  canonical copies, so `make hygiene` read red between the copy and the
  pin.
- The five skill descriptions are 200 characters or fewer, the ceiling
  the re-synced doclint enforces (conventions section 1). The four
  user-invoked skills keep their menu line short, and `respeak` keeps
  three of its quoted asks as its trigger; the agent keeps the full list.
  Hygiene no longer checks charters for sibling repository names, so that
  allow row drops `sibling`. The failure: the five descriptions ran from
  206 to 333 characters, so doclint refused all five.

## 0.6.1 (2026-09-22)

What the first conventions pass on this repository found. Each bullet
names the failure behind it.

- A tone file written by the `claude-code-session` plugin is a layer: the
  `respeak` section of its resolved file, when `provider.version` has major
  2, sits between the folder files and the environment and may set tone keys
  only. Before this, a session's chosen tone never reached the gate or the
  renderer. `respeak-config.sh explain` names the provider it read.
- The marketplace is named `claude-code-respeak`, after the repository, so
  the install line is `respeak@claude-code-respeak`: one marketplace per
  repository, named for it. The old name, `respeak`, was the plugin's.
  Anyone who added the marketplace under that name runs
  `claude plugin marketplace remove respeak`, then the two install lines in
  the README.
- `make check` runs the unit and bash suites, lint, `scripts/doclint`,
  `scripts/hygiene`, the README freshness check, and `claude plugin
  validate`. Before this, the checks were separate commands, and nothing
  checked relative links or names in the docs.
- The checks run under the pyenv virtualenv `.python-version` declares
  (3.12, PyYAML). Before this, a shell's `python3` could be Apple's 3.9
  or a pyenv shim without PyYAML, and the suites passed or failed by
  accident of PATH.
- `README.md` is rendered by `make readme` from `design/readme/source.md`,
  proved prose-only by `respeak-verify-edit.py`, and stamped in
  `design/readme/rendered.sha256`; `make check` refuses a stale README.
  Before this, the README was edited by hand and had grown to 40,089 bytes.
- `tests/test_overrides.sh` and `tests/test_gate_hook.sh` run
  `"${PYTHON:-python3}"` for their own JSON. Before this, they passed only
  when PATH put a PyYAML-capable `python3` first.
- The session id is read from `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` only. Before this,
  `/respeak:off` refused in a real session and `respeak-session.sh status`
  printed `session: unknown`: both read `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, which Claude
  Code does not set.
- `scripts/hygiene` and `scripts/doclint` are byte-identical to the
  canonical copies in `claude-code-session` again. Before this, both had
  drifted from them in their first line, and nothing noticed: `make hygiene`
  now checks their sha256 pins before it scans.
- `scripts/doclint` carries the canonical copy's own ceiling for
  `design/conventions*.md`, 8,192 bytes, and its pin moves with it. Before
  this, the copy here checked those files against the 6,144-byte record
  ceiling and differed from the canonical copy by that one rule.
- The plugin is the `plugin/` subtree, and the marketplace's source is
  `./plugin`: the manifest, `agents/`, `config/`, `corpus/`, `hooks/`,
  `skills/`, the sixteen shipped scripts, and `docs/config-layers.md`, which
  the skills and the agent name as the contract. Before this, the source was
  the repository root, so an install copied all 100 tracked files into the
  plugin cache, research, tests and history included. A checkout now loads
  with `claude --plugin-dir "$RESPEAK_SRC/plugin"`; paths under
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` do not change.
- `make doctor` runs `plugin/scripts/respeak-doctor.sh`: one line each for
  the python and PyYAML, `claude`, the marketplace and its source, the
  installed and manifest versions, the session provider, and unknown config
  keys. It exits 2 only when no python3 imports PyYAML. Before this, a hook
  with no PyYAML python exited 0 without a word, and nothing showed which
  source or version a session had loaded.
- `make install` installs the plugin from this checkout: it adds the
  marketplace when none is named `claude-code-respeak`, updates both when
  that marketplace is this checkout, and for any other source prints the
  source and the commands to switch, then exits 2. It never removes a
  registration. Before this, a local install was four hand-typed commands,
  and the marketplace on this Mac still came from GitHub.

## 0.6.0 (2026-09-21)

What a ten-agent editorial pass over nine household sites found on
2026-09-21, across about 2,000 edited files. Each bullet names the field
failure behind it.

- The style gate blocks on what a write introduced, not on every hit the
  file already held. The new key `gate.block_on: introduced | any`
  defaults to `introduced` and hands the scanner a baseline: the committed
  version of the file, else the pre-edit text rebuilt from the `Edit`
  call's own strings, else an empty file. Each step falls through on
  failure, so the hook still fails open. Before this, one error-severity
  hit the pass could not reach, a banned term inside a heading that
  `respeak-verify-edit.py` holds byte-identical, shut the file to every
  later edit. `block_on: any` restores the whole-file verdict, at any
  layer that may set `fail_on`.
- A write that adds nothing passes with a note rather than in silence. The
  hook prints one line of PostToolUse
  `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` naming the pre-existing hits that
  sit at or above the resolved `fail_on`, which is what `block_on: any`
  would have blocked on. Density-tier tells stay out of that line: on one
  real page they ran to 79 hits, mostly dashes, and naming them invites
  the layout edits an editorial pass is told not to make.
- `scripts/respeak-gate.sh --file` gains a new `--baseline-ref REF` flag,
  which asks what changed since REF for a build that gates a branch on its
  own diff. Otherwise it keeps whole-file semantics whatever `block_on`
  says, because the CI form has no edit to measure against.
- `respeak-measure.py DOC --baseline BASE` scans BASE with the same corpus
  and configuration, then splits DOC's hits per rule into `introduced` and
  `baseline`. Under a baseline, `--fail-on` sees only introduced hits and
  budgets that got worse, and the text report tags each rule line
  `[new N, pre-existing M]`. This is the mechanism `gate.block_on` runs
  on.
- HTML comments are exempt from the scan, as fenced code and blockquotes
  already were. Nothing inside a `<!-- ... -->` banner reaches the
  rendered page. Its words, its dashes and its phrases still counted
  against the page's budgets. Vendored banners alone put several published
  pages over the dash density.
- A URL is an address, not prose. A bare URL, an autolink, and the target
  of an inline link are dropped before the word and sentence counts, the
  way link targets already were. An address has no words to read and no
  sentence punctuation, so it inflated the word count and joined the lines
  around it into one long sentence. The link's label still counts.
- The sentence splitter reads Markdown structure. Cutting only at `.!?`
  read a bullet list as a single sentence. One site measured an average
  sentence of 68.9 words, and the pass reported bullet lists as long
  sentences on all nine. Prose is now cut into blocks at blank lines, and
  a list item or a table row opens a new unit. The list marker is not
  counted as a word, and each unit is then split at sentence punctuation.
  This repository's README drops from an 89-word longest sentence to 27,
  and from 15.1 to 13.0 average, with no prose changed. Every
  `avg_sentence_words` and `max_sentence_words` figure quoted from a
  pre-0.6.0 run is stale.
- A corpus entry may declare `case_sensitive: true`: its pattern and its
  exceptions then compile without `re.I`. That is what a placeholder-name
  rule needs, so `\b(Lyra|Eira|Jaxon|Elias)\b` now carries it and the LYRA
  pencil brand in a household catalog stops reading as an invented
  character. Matching stays case-insensitive without the key, and a value
  that is neither `true` nor `false` is a setup error.
- `respeak-measure.py --config` is documented in the module docstring and
  in `--help`. A run without it reads neither the project's `gate.allow`
  nor its `style.budgets`. A hand audit then over-counts any project that
  has tuned either: on one site's baseline, 36 reported errors against 13
  real ones. The help text names the `respeak-config.sh resolve` command
  that writes the file to pass.
- The verifier counts every line MkDocs would render as a heading. The old
  rule needed a space after the hashes, so a hard-wrapped line beginning
  `#33256` published as an H1 while the verifier passed the edit. A
  heading is now any line matching `^ {0,3}#{1,6}` outside fences, plus
  setext headings; a backslash-escaped `\#` is not one, which is the fix
  for a wrap that has to keep a number at the line start.
- New Markdown failure class, `block structure changed: <kind> N -> M`.
  Outside fences the verifier counts blockquote lines, bullet items,
  ordered items, thematic breaks, table rows, and definition lines, and
  reports each kind whose count moved. Ordered items count anywhere for
  `1.` or `1)` and only at a block start otherwise, because only `1.` can
  interrupt a paragraph. `--allow-restructure` reports the class as a
  warning instead.
- `--allow-strings` verifies an editorial pass over a page generator,
  whose display text lives in string literals. Both `.py` files are parsed
  with `ast` and every string constant is masked, so the two trees must
  still dump identically: a new dict entry, a changed call, a moved
  statement, or a changed number fails. Paired strings may then differ
  only with their numbers, `%` placeholders, `{}` fields, URLs, link
  targets, and inline code spans intact, and a docstring carrying `>>>`
  stays byte-identical.
- `--prose-keys KEYS` opens the display prose in Markdown front matter and
  in `.yaml` catalogs. KEYS is a comma-separated list of leaf key names,
  or `*` for every string leaf. Structure, key order, every unlisted
  value, and each scalar's quoting style stay invariant, and a listed
  string keeps its numbers, URLs, inline code spans, and link targets. For
  Markdown this replaces the whole-front-matter failure; the body is
  checked as before.
- `--dirs BEFORE AFTER` verifies two rendered trees, which is how an edit
  to a generator is proved at the level the reader sees. Every file both
  trees hold whose bytes differ is verified by its extension, and a type
  with no policy is SKIP rather than FAIL. A file on one side only is
  ADDED or REMOVED, and identical bytes are UNCHANGED. The output is one
  line per file plus a summary, or `--json` for the rows as a list, and
  exit 1 if any file fails.
- Eight corpus entries gain exceptions for the literal sense that tripped
  a real family page. `\bsymphony of\b` clears a Castlevania title,
  printed on 21 pages of a game catalog; `\bshowcas(e|es|ed|ing)\b` an
  in-game panel named that; `\bseamless(ly)?\b` a named fan project.
  `\bjourney\b` clears a Dragon Quest subtitle, `\bindelible( mark)?\b` an
  event name. `\bunderscor(e|es|ed|ing)\b` clears the literal character,
  and a sentence naming another separator or a filename beside it.
  `tapestry` clears the horticultural senses, `crisp` the food, texture
  and weather senses. Each exception is tested against the sentence window
  around the hit, so the cliche still flags.
- `^-{3,}$` (thematic break) and `[“”]` (curly quotes) move to
  `tier: density`. A generator or a vendored footer emits one per page, so
  per-occurrence counting made them the top warn on every site. 539 of one
  site's 565 break hits were the catalog card rule. 296 of another's quote
  hits sat inside publisher blurbs the pass must not reword. A
  density-tier hit no longer counts toward `warn_hits`; it counts toward
  `density_hits` and the `warn_phrases_per_1000_words` budget.
  `--fail-on warn` still trips on one, so a page whose own prose is
  littered with them still fails.
- New `tests/test_corpus.py`, 11 tests that scan the shipped corpus with
  the sentences the site pass met. For each exempted entry the literal
  sense passes and the cliche still flags; both retiered rules land in the
  density bucket; the stock-name entry matches with case.
- `agents/respeak.md` gains editorial-pass rules 5 to 12, the behaviors
  the field run showed the contract did not forbid. Never add, delete or
  correct a factual claim; report it instead. Rewrap without starting a
  line with `#` or `>`. Prose-to-list and list-to-prose count as
  restructure. Template and generator layout is advisory-only. A UI label
  gets the minimal compliant edit, never a rename. A generator edit
  changes string-literal content only, proved with `--dirs` and
  `--allow-strings`. Third-party text is never reworded, only reported
  with a proposed attribution. A banned term inside a heading needs
  `restructure: apply`.
- `scripts/respeak-check.sh --verify` reads each changed file's resolved
  `editorial_pass` and passes the verifier what it allows. `restructure:
  apply` becomes `--allow-restructure`, the new `verify.prose_keys` becomes
  `--prose-keys`, and `verify.allow_strings` becomes `--allow-strings`.
  `verify.paths` (git pathspecs) names the page generators and data files
  the check verifies as well, though never gates. The same three flags on
  the command line apply to one run. A `--prose-keys` violation is its own
  failure class, `front matter prose`, so it stays hard when
  `--allow-restructure` relaxes an unnamed front-matter change.
- The installed copy under `~/.claude/plugins/cache` is a snapshot, so run
  `claude plugin update respeak` to pick up the new gate behavior and the
  corpus changes.

## 0.5.2 (2026-09-15)

- The README status section is rewritten through the translator itself: a
  table of surfaces and their state, the unenforced config keys as a list,
  and version history delegated to this file. Its former heading announced
  honesty instead of showing it, and its first sentence ran 136 words.
- `scripts/respeak-check.sh`: the CI form of the gate. It runs the hook's
  verdict over every Markdown file git knows about, ignores session overrides on
  purpose, and with `--verify <ref>` requires each edit since that ref to be
  meaning-invariant. 16 checks in tests/test_check.sh, one of which is
  this repository's own docs passing its own gate.
- The repository configures respeak on itself: `.claude/respeak/config.yaml`
  names the human lane (README, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE.md, docs/) as a scope in
  technical mode for a peer engineer with structure advised, never applied;
  `CLAUDE.md` states how a session edits and checks those files and imports
  the lexicon digest generated from the corpus.
- The whole README went through the translator's editorial pass in
  technical mode: sentences over 25 words split, em-dashes removed from
  prose, walls of text broken at their seams. Every heading, link, code
  block, code span, and number is byte-identical to before, as checked by
  `respeak-verify-edit.py`. Average sentence length fell from 23 to 15
  words.
- The corpus rule for "the honest (assessment|take|answer|read)" now also
  catches "honest (status|update|summary|look)", with or without an
  article. Same category, same severity; the phrase count is unchanged.

## 0.5.1 (2026-09-15)

- `/respeak:report` runs a privacy pass on every report: identifying
  details (names, addresses, usernames, hosts, home paths, organizations,
  identifiers, anything token-shaped) are replaced with neutral
  placeholders, and the user confirms nothing privileged remains before the
  post. The environment footer shows a python under the home directory as
  `~/...`.
- A black-and-white megaphone icon at `assets/respeak-icon.svg`, shown at
  the top of the README.
- Every translation opens with a `📣 respeak · <mode>` marker line (the
  translator emits it, the skill relays it, the Stop-hook nudge asks for
  it), so a reader can tell the translator's voice from the agent's own.
  The headless renderer strips it from output files.

## 0.5.0 (2026-09-15)

- The PostToolUse style gate hook is registered again in `hooks/hooks.json`.
  A follow-up to 0.4.3 had removed it for one person's convenience, which
  made every documented gate knob a no-op for every installer. A test now
  pins the manifest's event list.
- Session overrides, above every configuration layer: `/respeak:off [gate]`
  and `/respeak:on [gate]` write a per-session marker; `RESPEAK_HOOKS=off`
  and `RESPEAK_GATE=off|on` do the same for one launch. Precedence is
  marker, environment, then configuration. `respeak-config.sh explain`
  ends with the override in force. Contract: docs/config-layers.md.
- `/respeak:report` files a GitHub issue against this repository through
  the GitHub CLI, with an environment footer and nothing from the project
  unless the user opts in and confirms.
- The SessionStart hook speaks only in projects with `.claude/respeak/`,
  uses the found interpreter, and reports counts correctly.
- The Stop hook whitelists the mode, profile, and tech level it puts into
  the model's context.
- The headless renderer drives Claude Code's print mode (`claude -p`);
  `RESPEAK_RENDER_CMD` and `RESPEAK_RENDER_MODEL` substitute a runner or
  model. `--budget-usd` is gone; `--max-rounds` bounds the spend.
- MIT license, with attributions for the condensed Wikipedia catalog
  (CC BY-SA 4.0) and the antislop-sampler influence (Apache-2.0). The
  manifest carries `license`, `author`, `homepage`, and `repository`.
- Documentation clean-room: install instructions use the GitHub
  marketplace form, example paths are placeholders, wording is neutral,
  and the research primer on Claude Code extension surfaces is rewritten
  for readers outside the project. The unpublishable field-test source
  documents are removed; the README keeps the measured numbers as sizing
  evidence.

## 0.4.3 (2026-09-04)

- Paths compare by key: symlink-resolved, case- and NFC-folded on macOS and
  Windows; a symlinked user config directory can no longer become the
  project root; in-project symlinks pointing outside are still gated.
- The interpreter cache moves to a trust-bounded directory under
  `${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-~/.cache}/respeak`; a tampered cache can at worst pick
  another known interpreter.
- `--set` reads boolean spellings on boolean keys; the statusline survives
  spaces in paths; skill commands are quoted; the scanner reads stdin.
- Follow-ups: the spaced-plugin-path limit is documented and announced at
  session start; this repo's own layered tone config is added.

## 0.4.2 (2026-09-04)

- Every measure setup error exits 2, so the gate fails open on a corrupt
  corpus, an invalid `gate.allow` regex, or a non-UTF-8 document instead of
  blocking with a traceback.

## 0.4.1 (2026-09-04)

- One project-root rule for every consumer; the user file is never promoted
  to project grade; symlink-safe path comparison; hooks fail open on setup
  errors; a Markdown-only gate contract; `allowed-tools` on the skills so
  the preamble runs under default permissions.

## 0.4.0 (2026-09-04)

- Layered configuration, nearest to the target wins: plugin defaults,
  install-time userConfig, user file, ancestor folder files, project file
  and gitignored local file, `scopes:`, folder files, `RESPEAK_CONFIG`,
  invocation flags. `scripts/respeak-config.py` resolves it; every hook,
  the skill, the statusline, and the headless renderer read through it.
- Governance keys are project-only. Audience profiles are expanded by the
  resolver. `/respeak:init` seeds a sparse project file.

## 0.3.0 (2026-09-02)

- Enforcement instead of instruction: `respeak-measure.py` gains
  `--fail-on`, budgets, `gate.allow`, per-entry exceptions, and JSON
  output; the PostToolUse gate hook blocks a failing Markdown write with the
  report; the skill verifies before relaying; the agent gates its input.

## 0.2 (2026-09-01)

- First release: governed shorthand lexicon with human ratification, the
  translator subagent with eli5, bluf, and technical modes, the banned-phrase
  corpus with provenance and density tiers, the style scanner, the
  format-aware edit-safety verifier, the lexicon digest renderer, and the
  statusline segment.
