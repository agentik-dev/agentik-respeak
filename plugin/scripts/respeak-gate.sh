# The style gate. Two entry points, one behaviour:
#
#   PostToolUse hook (hooks/hooks.json, matcher Write|Edit): reads the hook
#     JSON on stdin and gates tool_input.file_path.
#   CLI / CI:  respeak-gate.sh --file <path> [--committed] [--baseline-ref R]
#     gates one file the same way. --committed is the CI verdict: every
#     gate.* key comes from the plugin defaults and the committed project
#     file (its scopes included), each key dropped from another layer is
#     named on stderr, and a setup failure is exit 3, never an allow.
#
# It runs respeak-measure.py against a Markdown file (.md .markdown .mdx —
# the resolver's gate decision uses the same list) and blocks on a failing
# style-gate report.
#
# What a verdict is measured against is `gate.block_on`. The default,
# `introduced`, hands measure a --baseline of the file as it was, so the
# write is judged on the hits it ADDED and a document that already carries
# one (a banned term inside a heading, which the editorial pass may not be
# able to move) stays editable; the leftovers are reported to the model
# instead, as PostToolUse additionalContext on a pass. `any` drops the
# baseline and gates the whole file, the behaviour before v0.6.
#
# The baseline, in order: the committed version of the file
# (`git show HEAD:./<name>`); else, for an Edit, the pre-edit text rebuilt
# by putting tool_input.old_string back where new_string now sits; else an
# empty file, so a brand-new document is gated whole. Each step falls
# through to the next on any failure, and RESPEAK_GATE_TRACE=1 names the
# one used. The --file form has no edit to compare against and is the CI
# surface, so it keeps whole-file semantics whatever block_on says, unless
# --baseline-ref REF names a git ref to measure against.
#
# Opt-in per project, deliberately: nothing happens unless the PROJECT layer
# (<project>/.claude/respeak/config.yaml or config.local.yaml) sets
# `gate.enabled: true`. A user-level file or a folder .respeak.yaml cannot
# turn it on (the resolver drops gate.enabled from those layers). Nearer
# layers CAN soften or harden the verdict for their own files
# (`gate.fail_on`) and add `gate.allow` regexes. The project root is found
# by the resolver the same way for every consumer (nearest
# .claude/respeak/config.yaml above the file, then $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR),
# so what `respeak-config.sh explain --for <file>` shows is what this
# script enforces. Contract: docs/config-layers.md.
#
# Session overrides (scripts/respeak-override.sh) sit above the config:
# RESPEAK_HOOKS=off or RESPEAK_GATE=off silences the gate for a launch,
# RESPEAK_GATE=on runs it as if gate.enabled were true, and a marker from
# /respeak:off or /respeak:on does the same for one session and outranks
# the environment. The --file form has no session, so only the
# environment applies to it.
#
# Exit 0 = allow (not applicable, gate off, overridden off, the file passed,
#          or a setup problem — the gate fails OPEN; set RESPEAK_GATE_TRACE=1
#          to get a one-line stderr note saying which). A pass over a file
#          that still carries hits the write did not introduce prints one
#          line of JSON on stdout naming them, as PostToolUse
#          additionalContext.
# Exit 2 = block; stderr carries the measure report, which Claude Code feeds
#          back to the model as the error to fix. In CI, `|| exit 1` on it.
# Bounds, so a write never waits on the gate past the hook's 20 s: a file
# over RESPEAK_GATE_MAX_BYTES (default 2097152) blocks with "too large to
# gate", and measure runs under respeak-deadline.sh for RESPEAK_GATE_DEADLINE
# seconds (default 15); a measure past its deadline is a setup failure.
#
# Exit 3 = --committed only: no verdict (no python, a resolver failure, a
#          measure setup error); stderr names the reason. The CI side
#          refuses to guess where the hook fails open.
