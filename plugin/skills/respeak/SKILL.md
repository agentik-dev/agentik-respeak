# respeak — render a narrative

Effective configuration for the working directory (plugin defaults,
`~/.claude/respeak/config.yaml`, the project's `.claude/respeak/config.yaml`
and its `scopes:`, any folder `.respeak.yaml`; nearest wins. The contract
is `docs/config-layers.md`):

!`"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/respeak-config.sh" explain --brief --launch-dir "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"`

The last line above names any session override in force. Overrides silence
hooks; they never change this skill, which runs because the user asked.

Steps:

1. Determine the mode. `$mode` if given and one of `eli5|bluf|technical`;
   otherwise infer from the audience the user named (a child, a newcomer,
   "plain English" → eli5; a manager, exec, "bottom line", "leadership" →
   bluf; an engineer, reviewer, "for the PR/docs" → technical); otherwise
   the effective `narrative.default_mode` shown above, which already
   reflects the user, project, and folder layers for this directory.
2. Determine the source material. `$source` if given (text or a readable
   file path); otherwise this session's most recent substantive outcome —
   the latest completed task, findings, or state change, including any
   shorthand used along the way.
3. Resolve the configuration for the target. The target is the source file
   when `$source` is a file path (a folder's `.respeak.yaml` governs the
   files in it), otherwise the working directory. Run (quote the paths as
   shown; `--out` writes the file so no shell redirect is needed):
   `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/respeak-config.sh" resolve --for "<target>" --launch-dir "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}" [--mode <mode>] --format yaml --out "/tmp/respeak-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}.yaml"`
   Add `--profile <name>` when the user named an audience that matches a
   profile the config defines under `profiles:` (for example "for the exec
   audience" → `exec`, or a household profile the user defined at user level);
   run `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/respeak-config.sh" explain --for "<target>" --launch-dir "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"`
   when you need the full layer-by-layer listing.
4. Delegate to the `respeak:respeak` agent with: the mode, the contents of
   that resolved config file verbatim under a heading
   `Resolved respeak configuration`, the source material, and the working
   directory; ask it for its `uses:` line. Do not translate inline
   yourself — the agent owns the corpus gates and lexicon bookkeeping, and
   an inline paraphrase bypasses both.
5. Verify before relaying — do not trust the agent's narrative on its own
   report. First drop each reply's last line when it reads `uses: …`:
   step 6 records it; it is neither scanned nor relayed. Feed the narrative
   to the scanner on stdin (a heredoc; no temp file, so no file-write
   permission is needed):
   ```
   "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/py" respeak-measure.py - --fail-on error --config "/tmp/respeak-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}.yaml" <<'RESPEAK_EOF'
   <the narrative, verbatim>
   RESPEAK_EOF
   ```
   (the resolved config carries every layer's `gate.allow` and
   `style.budgets`, so a project's or folder's exceptions apply).
   - Exit 0: relay the narrative verbatim, its opening `📣 respeak · <mode>`
     marker line included — do not re-wrap, soften, or append commentary.
     If the agent omitted the marker, add it as the first line.
   - Exit 1: send the printed report back to the `respeak:respeak` agent and
     ask for a rewrite that clears every error-severity hit; run the check
     again. Allow at most 2 rounds total.
   - Still exit 1 after 2 rounds: relay the narrative anyway (marker line
     first), with the final measure report appended under a `respeak gate:
     still failing after 2 rounds` heading — the human sees exactly what did not clear, instead of
     a silently-shipped violation. Do not attempt a 3rd round yourself.
6. Record the uses, once, from the agent's first `uses:` line; `uses: none`
   records nothing. For each `` `<term>` <outcome> `` item, run
   `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/py" respeak-lexicon.py use '<term>' --outcome <outcome> [--readback] --source "<source>" --root "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"`
   with `--readback` when the item ends in `readback`, and `<source>` the
   `$source` file path, else `session ${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}`. A refusal
   naming `no .claude/respeak/` means the project keeps no use record: skip
   the rest silently. Name any other refusal in one line after the narrative.
7. If the agent reports lexicon proposals, list the proposed terms in one
   line and note that ratification is pending per the shorthand config.
