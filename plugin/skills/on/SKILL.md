# respeak: on for this session

Run exactly this command and relay its output to the user as written:

```sh
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/respeak-session.sh" on $ARGUMENTS
```

If it exits 2 there is no session id; relay its message, which tells the
user to launch with `RESPEAK_GATE=on` instead.

Do not edit any configuration file. To turn the gate on for a project
permanently, set `gate.enabled: true` in `.claude/respeak/config.yaml`.
